 This repo contains projects for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.

 This course focuses on Data Wrangling and Data Visualization. I started this online course September 15th 2023.

 ### Part 1: Investigate a Dataset - Introduction to Data Analysis

 Learn the data analysis process of wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data. Work with data in Python, using libraries such as NumPy and Pandas.

 ### Part 2: Real World Data Wrangling - Advanced Data Wrangling

 Data Wrangling is a set of processes for turning raw and messy data into a clean format to answer interesting questions from the data. This part or course shows the three phases of data wrangling: gathering, assessing, and cleaning data.


 ### Part 3: Communicate Data Findings - Data Visualization 

 Learn to apply sound design and data visualization principles to the data analysis process. Learn how to use analysis and visualization to tell a story with data.
